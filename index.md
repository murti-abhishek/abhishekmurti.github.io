# About Me

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

Bonjour! My name is Abhishek Murti. I pursued my Bachelors degree from BITS, Pilani in India and then obtained my Masters degree from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Limited  hand-eye coordination and extreme lack of interest, drove me towards computational work. Back in undergrad it used to be Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) but during (and ever since) my Masters, it's Computational Biology. Believe it or not, I used to develop ODE and constraints based mathematical models to study cell-free systems (read as: Systems Biology)

I currently work as a data scientist/bioinformatician at University of California, San Francisco. I work in the Wang Lab at UCSF, where we aim to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that maintain the liver during health and disease. In my current position, I work with sequencing data, primarily, single cell and single nuclei data. My role is divided into two major parts. The first part of my job is to align the sequencing data to the corresponding reference genome, predominantly, human and mouse genomes. This requires knowledge of sequencing techniques such as 10X and Seqwell, along with a strong grasp of the bash programming language and various command line tools. Moreover, since bioinformatic tools are computationally intensive, I also work with High Performance Computing clusters and other cloud computing platforms such as Google Cloud Platform. After aligning samples and translating genomic data in to useful information such as gene expression matrices, I transition into the second part of my job which requires me to operate as a data scientist, and analyze these expression matrices through bioinformatic pipelines. This allows me to use, modify and developed analysis pipelines in Python and R, to answer predetermined scientific questions and uncover new information about liver physiology.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
